game-maker
==========

My high school senior project; inspired/based on GameMaker 7.0 by YoyoGames (see http://www.yoyogames.com/studio).

It's very rough around the edges, but hopefully the provided examples can show you how to use it.
Familiarity with YoyoGames' GameMaker should help a lot.

Included are some example games so you can see how things work.
These examples are in no way meant to be complete, polished games; their job is merely to show off some of the basics that are possibile in my game engine.

Make sure when you run these classes that you first compile the gameMaker package.
Then, when compiling one of these games, make sure the gameMaker package is on the classpath.
(I used Eclipse to compile and run this project)

In general, the control keys are the arrows keys, WASD, the space bar, and the left mouse button.
At any time, pressing the escape key will exit the game and pressing the f1 key will restart the game.
