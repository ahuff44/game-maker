game-maker
==========

My high school senior project; inspired/based on GameMaker 7.0 by YoyoGames (see http://www.yoyogames.com/studio). Very rough around the edges.

Sorry about the lack of comments... I'm wishing I'd put them in too.

Included are some example games so you can see how things work.
These examples are in no way meant to be complete, polished games; their job is merely to show off some of the basics that are possibile in my game engine.
Frogger:
    ![screenshot of frogger](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/game-maker/screenshots/frogger.png)
    Run the main class frogger.FroggerGameController
Safari:
    ![screenshot of safari](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/game-maker/screenshots/safari.png)
    Run the main class safari.SafariGameController
Snake:
    ![screenshot of snake](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/game-maker/screenshots/snake.png)
    Run the main class snake.SnakeGameController
Space:
    ![screenshot of space](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/game-maker/screenshots/space.png)
    Run the main class space.SpaceGameBackgroundController

Make sure when you run these classes that you first compile the gameMaker package. Then, when compiling one of these games, make sure the gameMaker package is on the classpath. (To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to launch one of these games from the commandline. I played around with a bunch of the flags available in javac and java, but I couldn't get it to work. I personally compiled and ran everything in Eclipse for this project)
