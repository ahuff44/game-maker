game-maker
==========

My high school senior project; inspired/based on GameMaker 7.0 by YoyoGames (see http://www.yoyogames.com/studio).

It's very rough around the edges, but hopefully the provided examples can show you how to use it.
Familiarity with YoyoGames' GameMaker should help a lot.

Included are some example games so you can see how things work.
These examples are in no way meant to be complete, polished games; their job is merely to show off some of the basics that are possibile in my game engine.

Make sure when you run these classes that you first compile the gameMaker package.
Then, when compiling one of these games, make sure the gameMaker package is on the classpath.
(To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to launch one of these games from the command line.
I messed around with a bunch of the flags available in javac and java, but I couldn't get it to work.
I personally compiled and ran everything in Eclipse for this project)

In general, the control keys are the arrows keys, WASD, the space bar, and the left mouse button.
At any time, pressing <esc> will exit the game and pressing <f1> will restart the game.
